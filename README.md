# Where are the sources ?

This is the repository for https://www.cdnpkg.com . This project was started as a private project for fun on bitbucket, but as it might be useful for others the choice was made to open source it. Some work has to be done before it can be fully migrated on this repo, meanwhile you can submit issues or feature requests here !


# What is CNDPKG ?

To say it very simply: CDNPKG is like a search engine for web assets: css, js and other usefull resource for web developers.
